# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project was created while following a tutorial by CodeWithHarry (YouTube).

## Features

- Two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game (X vs O)
- Basic win/draw detection and UI updates
- Simple, clean layout with responsive grid

## Files

- `index.html` — Page markup and game board
- `style.css` — Visual styling for the board and UI
- `script.js` — Game logic (handling clicks, turns, win/draw checks)
- `README.md` — This file

## How to run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or open it from your browser's File > Open).
2. (Optional) Serve the folder with a simple static server for a consistent experience. For example, using Python 3 from PowerShell:

```powershell
# from the project folder
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
